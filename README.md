# Result-Processing-API
A simple result processing API created for my CSE 4636 course using Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and the Java Persistence API.

To run this project, a server is required. Example: `Apache Tomcat`

After running the project, try out the various endpoints.
You may do so by writing the URL manually on your browser or by using an API Building Platform like `Postman`.
